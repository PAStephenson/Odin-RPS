# Odin Rock Paper Scissors
A browser version of the classic rock, paper, scissors game but with a magical twist. Rather than
rocks, paper and scissors the player and their computer opponent each pick a magic spell.

Possible spells include: the aggressive attack spell, the disarm spell to hinder your opponent and
the defensive block spell.

## Rules
Attack beats Disarm, Disarm beats Block, Block beats Attack
